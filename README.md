# George Swarbrick

I am an intuitive and focused individual with impeccable verbal and written communication skills and as i've written that i've given myself immense pressure not to have any spelling errors from now on. I have been in several fringe theatre performances in London which have given me a great deal of confidence and experience with public speaking, teamwork, coordination and memory. I’m a creative person with an interest in the arts and various different forms of media. What brought me to coding is the constant joy of small and successful small steps witin my code such as problem solving. I suppose that is what all humans crave, small pats on the back, be it from yourself or others; recognision. 

### Skills
I'm not entirely sure what skills would be relevent to software design other than the typical i'm a nice guy who just wants to do his best. No one is ever going to be the best at what they do, but you can always do your best. 

#### I do the thing

Whether or not you can call this a skill or some sort of OCD it is up to your discretion. However i have an uncanny ability to be comsumed by what i am doing until i get it done. This could mean sleepless nights, arriving a hour eary and spending too much money on coffees. I suppose its just the fear of failing that causes it. Call it a skill or just me being me. Though this 'skill' has mean i've kept up to date with the workload that has been given to me. 

#### Trustworthy 

Throughout my career people seem to be able to trust me, through no fault of my own. I list a few examples below in my career history and at the risk of repeating myself i'll name a couple of examples that i know i missed out. I was a restaurant supervisor at the time; i had a table; they left and didn't pay. This is ultimatley my fault. I was informed by my superiors and i immediately offered to pay for their bill as i recognised it was my wrong doing. In time this sort of ethos lead to my promotion to restaurant manager and with that more trust.

## Experience

#### Shop Manager:
June 2018 – July 2019: I was a manager at the Butcher & Bab based in Liverpool Street, London. It is a
food unit that specialises in guilt-free gourmet kebabs. I was in charge of orders and prep, as well as
serving during service and opening and closing the shop itself. I was also in charge of ordering certain
products and developing a relationship with our suppliers. Throughout my time there I spearheaded 
multiple improvements to the work environment including things such as better equipment to more
efficient use of storage space. I trained, one on one, with other individuals that were starting out and taught 
them their specific roles; helping them along the way and bolstering their confidence. My employers had
great trust in me, this meant that they could safely go away on holiday for a few weeks at a time. The unit
in Liverpool Street is their first shop, thus the trust they had in me was significant enough for them them to 
leave me in charge of their introduction into the entrepreneurial world.

##### Bartender/Floor Supervisor/Restaurant Manager:
February 2017 – May 2018: I worked at The Red Lion Pub in Leytonstone as a bartender, then as a waiter. Then I was promoted to floor supervisor and again to restaurant/floor manager. My roles developed throughout my time and by the end of it I had built a good relationship with my employers, enough for them to trust me to be in charge of food related documentation and opening and closing the pub/venue. I trained new employees of the company and built a rapport with them so they didn’t feel scared to approach me should something go wrong. 

##### Venue Manager:
December 2016 – February 2017: I occasionally work for The Lion and Unicorn Theatre in Kentish town where I act as the active manager when the owner isn’t there, making sure the director and cast are all sorted with their needs. I was responsible for getting the audience in on time with the schedule that had been arranged with the director beforehand. I sorted out seats, ensuring that the theatre did not go over capacity and managed the money through tickets. 

##### Events & Office Administrator:
February 2015 – July 2016: I worked as an events and office administrator at the Cambridge Union Society. My main roles were speaking and meeting with clients for their events at our venue, organising the Union’s calendar so everyone knew what is going on, so there were no conflicts. I made sure people knew what they needed to do during an event and to fulfil as many needs that the client may have had. I built relationships with clients in order for them to consider us again as a venue should they choose to have another conference/event with us.

# Interests and Achievements

During my time in education I attended as many plays as I could. I also was in the school teams for rugby and hockey. I’ve been around Europe, seen a lot of different places and met a lot of different people. I’ve been to New York and Dublin just to see plays. My interests lie in theatre, hanging out with my friends and playing games (sports or video, mostly the latter). 

I was a member of the London Voice and Motion Theatre Company based in London learning a variety of different acting techniques, singing and dancing. This was between 2014-2017. I performed in several plays in London. My roles varied from drama to comedy, lead roles to supporting ones.
